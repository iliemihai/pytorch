    "This tutorial will walk you through the key ideas of deep learning programming using Pytorch. Many of the concepts (such as the computation graph abstraction and autograd) are not unique to Pytorch and are relevant to any deep learning tool kit out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am writing this tutorial to focus specifically on NLP for people who have never written code in any deep learning framework (e.g, TensorFlow, Theano, Keras, Dynet). It assumes working knowledge of core NLP problems: part-of-speech tagging, language modeling, etc. It also assumes familiarity with neural networks at the level of an intro AI class (such as one from the Russel and Norvig book). Usually, these courses cover the basic backpropagation algorithm on feed-forward neural networks, and make the point that they are chains of compositions of linearities and non-linearities. This tutorial aims to get you started writing deep learning code, given you have this prerequisite knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note this is about models, not data. For all of the models, I just create a few test examples with small dimensionality so you can see how the weights change as it trains. If you have some real data you want to try, you should be able to rip out any of the models from this notebook and use them on it."

The parameters of the model are then updated by taking the derivative of the loss function.

If it is very confident in its answer, and its answer is correct, the loss will be low.\n",

For supervised multi-class classification, this means training the network to minimize the negative log probability of the correct output (or equivalently, maximize the log probability of the correct output)."

Torch provies many in the torch.optim package, and they are all completely transparent. Using the simplest gradient update is the same as the more complicated algorithms. Trying different update algorithms and different parameters for the update algorithms (like different initial learning rates) is important in optimizing your network's performance.

But how should you represent a word in a computer? You could store its ascii character representation, but that only tells you what the word is, it doesn't say much about what it means (you might be able to derive its part of speech from its affixes, or properties from its capitalization, but not much). Even more, in what sense could you combine these representations? We often want dense outputs from our neural networks, where the inputs are $|V|$ dimensional, where $V$ is our vocabulary, but often the outputs are only a few dimensional (if we are only predicting a handful of labels, for instance). How do we get from a massive dimensional space to a smaller dimensional space?\n",

That is, we represent the word $w$ by$$ \\overbrace{\\left[ 0, 0, \\dots, 1, \\dots, 0, 0 \\right]}^\\text{|V| elements} $$where the 1 is in a location unique to $w$. Any other word will have a 1 in some other location, and a 0 everywhere else.\n",

This is what we mean by a notion of similarity: we mean semantic similarity, not simply having similar orthographic representations. It is a technique to combat the sparsity of linguistic data, by connecting the dots between what we have seen and what we haven't. This example of course relies on a fundamental linguistic assumption: that words appearing in similar contexts are related to each other semantically.

Think of some other attributes, and imagine what you might score some common words on those attributes.\n",

Central to the idea of deep learning is that the neural network learns representations of the features, rather than requiring the programmer to design them herself. So why not just let the word embeddings be parameters in our model, and then be updated during training? This is exactly what we will do. We will have some latent semantic attributes that the network can, in principle, learn. Note that the word embeddings will probably not be interpretable. That is, although with our hand-crafted vectors above we can see that mathematicians and physicists are similar in that they both like coffee, if we allow a neural network to learn the embeddings and see that both mathematicians and physicisits have a large value in the second dimension, it is not clear what that means. They are similar in some latent semantic dimension, but this probably has no interpretation to us.\n",

    "Before we get to a worked example and an exercise, a few quick notes about how to use embeddings in Pytorch and in deep learning programming in general. Similar to how we defined a unique index for each word when making one-hot vectors, we also need to define an index for each word when using embeddings. These will be keys into a lookup table. That is, embeddings are stored as a $|V| \\times D$ matrix, where $D$ is the dimensionality of the embeddings, such that the word assigned index $i$ has its embedding stored in the $i$'th row of the matrix. In all of my code, the mapping from words to indices is a dictionary named word_to_ix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module that allows you to use embeddings is torch.nn.Embedding, which takes two arguments: the vocabulary size, and the dimensionality of the embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "To index into this table, you must use torch.LongTensor (since the indices are integers, not floats)."

    "To do the prediction, pass an LSTM over the sentence. Denote the hidden state at timestep $i$ as $h_i$. Also, assign each tag a unique index (like how we had word_to_ix in the word embeddings section). Then our prediction rule for $\\hat{y}_i$ is$$ \\hat{y}_i = \\text{argmax}_j \\  (\\log \\text{Softmax}(Ah_i + b))_j $$That is, take the log softmax of the affine map of the hidden state, and the predicted tag is the tag that has the maximum value in this vector. Note this implies immediately that the dimensionality of the target space of $A$ is $|T|$."
